# dealer-data-tracker

## Description
    We embarked on this project to be able to track any metrics that a workplace might like to keep track of. This specific app was built with a pokerhouse in mind. Created to allow supervisors to keep records when they audit their dealers metrics and store them to track a dealers preformance over time.
